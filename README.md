# trade-feed-etl-health-checker

**trade-feed-etl-health-checker** is an automated infrastructure management solution designed to handle trade feed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes across multiple environments, including Dev, QA, and Prod. This repository provides Ansible playbooks and scripts for deploying, managing, and terminating ETL infrastructure on AWS, with built-in security features like password validation and environment-specific AWS profiles.

## Key Features

- **Environment-Specific Infrastructure**: Supports multiple environments (Dev, QA, Prod, etc.), each with its own configuration.
- **Secure Operations**: Passwords and encryption keys are securely stored in a JSON file in the user's home directory and are validated before executing operations.
- **AWS Profile Integration**: Automatically loads AWS profiles from environment-specific YAML files stored within each environment's directory.
- **Automated Setup and Termination**: Includes playbooks for setting up and tearing down PostgreSQL databases, AWS EventBridge, AWS Lambda, and AWS SES.
- **Test Data Generation**: Playbooks to generate test data for trade feed ETL processes.
- **Controlled Execution via npm**: All playbooks and scripts are executed via npm scripts, allowing for consistent and controlled operations.

## Directory Overview

- **`envs/`**: Contains subdirectories for each environment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`, `qa`). Each subdirectory contains:
  - **`password.enc`**: The encrypted password file for the environment.
  - **`<environment>.yml`**: The configuration file for the environment.
- **`playbooks/`**: Includes Ansible playbooks for setting up and managing infrastructure components like PostgreSQL, AWS services, and more.
- **`run_protected_playbook.sh`**: A shell script that securely executes Ansible playbooks after validating the password and loading the correct AWS profile.
- **`validate_pwd_for_ansible_pb_run.py`**: A Python script that validates the password against encrypted data stored in the environment files.
- **`package.json`**: Defines npm scripts to execute the playbooks and manage infrastructure across different environments.

## Getting Started for Users

If you're a user of the `trade-feed-etl-health-checker` codebase, follow these steps to set up your environment and start using the tools provided:

### 1. **Ensure Required Tools Are Installed**

Before you start, make sure you have the necessary tools installed on your system:

- **jq**: A lightweight JSON processor.
- **Ansible**: For running the playbooks.
- **Python 3**: Required for password validation.
- **AWS CLI**: For interacting with AWS services.
- **npm**: For managing and executing scripts.

Refer to the "Prerequisites" section in this `README.md` for installation instructions specific to your operating system.

### 2. **Configure the JSON File in Your Home Directory**

Create a JSON file named `trade-feed-etl-health-checker.json` in your home directory. This file stores the encryption keys and passwords for each environment:

```bash
touch ~/trade-feed-etl-health-checker.json
touch ~/trade-feed-etl-health-checker_us-east-1_dev-us-east-1.json
touch ~/trade-feed-etl-health-checker_eu-west-1_qa-eu-west-1.json
touch ~/trade-feed-etl-health-checker_ap-south-1_prod-ap-south-1.json
```

### 3. **(Optional) Update the password.enc Files**
If you need to update the password.enc files for any environment (e.g., after changing the encryption key or password), you can do so using the following command:

```shell
echo -n "your-new-password" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -salt -pass pass:your-new-encryption-key -out envs/<environment>/password.enc
```

### 4. **Run the Playbooks Using npm**

With your environment set up and the necessary tools installed, you can now run the provided Ansible playbooks using npm. Here are some common commands you might use:
